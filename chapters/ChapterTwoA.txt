You played it safe and waited for it to turn green
good thing to as a car came out of no where racing down the road
You finally make it home but notice a black SUV parked out front.
As well as your door bashed through your mind suddenly going through
multiple possiblities but you need to act quick do you 1 hide or 2 investigate
